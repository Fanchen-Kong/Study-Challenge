**Aims:**

In this course we study a number of building blocks of high-frequency (microwave) transmitters and receivers of communication systems. The basic techniques for the description and design of these circuits are taught, and are afterwards applied to the different building blocks. The stress is on working distributed components as alternative for discrete components, and on thinking in terms of travelling waves as alternative to localized voltage and current.

**Lecture:**

Transmission lines in the frequency domain and in the time domain

The use of S-parameters for the characterization of RF-circuits

Basic techniques for fundamental passive building blocks and methods of implementation

RF-amplifiers: design an relation to low frequency techniques (design, noise, power)
