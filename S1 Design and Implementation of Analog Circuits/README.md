# S1 Design and Implementation of Analog Circuits

**Aims:**

This course is about the design, the layout and the implementation analog circuits, with a strong emphasis on integrated transistor circuits.

The student understands the different trade-offs related to the design of a transistor circuit

The student can design and optimize an analog amplifier for a given set of high-level specifications

The students understand the benefits and drawbacks of feedback and can apply feedback on an analog circuit

**Lecture:**

transistors: biasing and small signal models

MOS transistor models: Weak inversion and velocity saturation

Feedback: basics, stability, opamp basics

Simple amplifier circuits: CS, CD, CG + extensions

Current mirror + Cascode

Differential Pair +Basic OTA

Symmetrical OTA + Folded cascode OTA

Two-stage OTA and Miller compensation

Rail-to-Rail OTA

Common-mode Feedback

Noise in transistor circuits

Distortion in transistor circuits

Mismatch in transistor circuits
