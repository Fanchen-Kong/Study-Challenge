# S3 Computer Platforms for AI and Embedded Processing

**Aims:**

The aim of this course is to learn to design larger digital integrated systems-on-chip (SoCs), and this especially in the area of AI and perceptive sensory systems. The course will start from the design, computer architecture and methodology knowledge gathered from previous courses. Special attention will be given to :

acquiring knowledge on state-of-the-art efficiency enhancement techniques used in processors and accelerators

the design trade-offs between performance, cost, power usage and flexibility

the tight interplay and co-optimizations between hardware and algorithms (HW-alg co-design).

**Lecture:**

Evolution in (embedded) processor chips

Overview of AI hardware, computer architectures for AI and deep learning

Processor tecniques for power management and adaptive operation of large SoC

Design verficiation using system verilog

Guest lecture on industrial SoC development
