# S2 Antennas for PCBs, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology

**Aims:**

The course involves the basic analysis of radiation and antennas. The fundamental goal is explicitly to point out the totally different way of thinking in the this field compared to basic circuit theory, where the wave behavior is not relevant. The student has to be able to characterize radiation phenomena, based on their properties. He has to know the basic terminology in radiation and has to be able to give a schematic overview of different types of antennas and their working mechanisms.

**Lecture:**

The course consists of 10 sessions:

Session 1: Introduction and terminology

Session 2: Basic parameters and their properties

Session 3: Electric and magnetic dipole, incremental sources

Session 4: Wire antennas

Session 5: Computational Electromagnetics in antenna design

Session 6: Array Antennas and beam steering

Session 7: Radiation Measurements

Session 8: Microstrip, planar, quasi 3D, and 3D antennas

Session 9: Electrically small antennas

Session 10: Antennas: selected overview: resonant antennas, traveling wave antennas, Yagi antennas, helical antennas
