# S3 MEMS and Microsystems

**Aims:**

This course aims at bringing insight to the student on the possiblities of creating microstructures, mainly based upon the techniques normally used in standard IC manufacturing. It highlights several MEMS devices.

**Lecture:**

This course gives an overview of the recent developments in the creation of microelectromechanical structures (MEMS) in silicon. Both sensors and actuators are discussed. Main focus is towards miniaturisation. Finally, some examples of complete operational systems are shown, and problems such as interconnection, packaging and reliability come under focus.
