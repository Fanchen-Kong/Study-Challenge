# S2 Design of Digital Integrated Circuits

**Aims:**

Deepen the knowledge about digital integrated circuit design. The common thread throughout the course is the optimisation of digital circuits in view of the energy verus performance trade off.

**Lecture:**

There are four basic themes in the course

\- design of advanced digital logic beyond standard CMOS logic

\- design and use of IP blocks

\- low power, low energy design

\- production test of digital circuits
