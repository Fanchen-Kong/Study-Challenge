# Semiconductor Physics (Supplemented Course)

**Aims:**

The purpose of this course is to provide the necessary basics of solid state physics in order to allow the student to well understand and describe the operation of present and future semiconductor devices. In view of the continuous scaling of such components, a very strict application of the principles of quantum mechanics becomes mandatory. The focus of the course is on acquiring physical insight in the properties of semiconductors. This course is the indispensable basis for other courses such as Semiconductor devices, advanced nanoelectronics devices, electronic and opto-electronic systems.
