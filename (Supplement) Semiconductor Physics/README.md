This course is the supplement course of my project.

The purpose of this course is to provide the essential foundations required to understand the operation of semiconductor devices.  I first took series of fundamental courses (about 10hs/course) to gain a better understanding of the necessary physics picture of semiconductor devices. Then I took the full advanced course ***Solid State Circuit 1*** (16 weeks for 7-10 hours/week), from Purdue MSECE course, to encapsulate the whole course. 

I took the *Primer on Semiconductor Fundamentals*, taught by Prof. Mark Lundstrom, in order to gain a framework for understanding the operation of semiconductor device. 

After that, I took the *Concise Solid State Physics*, taught by Prof. Yicong Ye.
