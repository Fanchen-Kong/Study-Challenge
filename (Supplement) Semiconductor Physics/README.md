This course is the supplement course of my project.

The purpose of this course is to provide the essential foundations required to understand the operation of semiconductor devices.  

I took the *Primer on Semiconductor Fundamentals*, taught by Prof. Mark Lundstrom, first in order to gain a framework for understanding the operation of semiconductor device. 

After that, I took the *Concise Solid State Physics*, taught by Prof. Yicong Ye.
