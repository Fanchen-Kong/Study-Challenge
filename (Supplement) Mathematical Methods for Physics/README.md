This course is the supplement course of my project.

The purpose of this supplement course on Mathematical Methods for Physics is to review necessary basics of complex analysis, linear algebra, numerical methods, partial differential equation and various related topics in order to allow me to well understand the mathematics and physics behind the semiconductor devices.

In the first part of learning mathematical methods for physics, followed the organization of Wu's book, I reviewed some key concepts of complex analysis including Analytic Functions, Conformal Mappings, Complex Integration, Power Series, Laurent Series and the Residue Theorem by taking [Introduction to Complex Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/complex-analysis),.
