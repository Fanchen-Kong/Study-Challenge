This course is the supplement course of my project.

In the first part of learning mathematical methods for physics, followed the organization of Wu's book, I reviewed some key concepts of complex analysis including Analytic Functions, Conformal Mappings, Complex Integration, Power Series, Laurent Series and the Residue Theorem by taking [Introduction to Complex Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/complex-analysis),.
