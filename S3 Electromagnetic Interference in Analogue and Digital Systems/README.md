# S3 Electromagnetic Interference in Analogue and Digital Systems

**Aims:**

This course studies the influence of the ever more agressive electromagnetic 'radiation' environment on the telecom devices that are present in it, and vice versa.

**Lecture:**

The use of more and more electrical and electronical devices within the same space has drastic consequences for the correct functioning of these devices. In this course, it will be indicated clearly in which basic manners different devics can be linked to each other, and thus how they can disturb each other. Afterwards, it will be investigated how, for different important practical cases one can optimally design a matching telecom system, and secondly, how a problem diagnosis can be made and a remedy can be found for existing telecom systems.
