# S2 Computer Architecture

**Aims:**

This course gives the student a detailed insight into the architecture and organization of modern computer systems. After this course students should be able to:

1. Explain the differences between commercially available computer systems and choose the best suited architecture for a given application

2. Use hardware knowledge to optimize the execution of computer applications, and application knowledge to optimize underlying hardware

3. Critically discuss current trade-offs of computer architectures, illustrate them with a real life example, and grasp new developments and trends in the field of computer architectures.

The goal of the exercise sessions is to understand and apply knowledge from theoretical ex-cathedra sessions, and from the studied material.

- analyze and evaluate computer architectures
- understand the inside of microprocessors and computers
- design (simple) computer architectures

**Lecture:**

The Processor micro-architecture

Enhancing Performance with Pipelining
