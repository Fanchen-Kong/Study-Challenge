# S1 Analog and Mixed-Signal Electronics for Signal Processing

**Aims:**

This course describes the most important analog building blocks as used in electronic systems for signal processing. Based on the operating principle of these blocks, the goal is to understand the most relevant properties for systems and signal processing applications in telecommunications, multimedia, biomedical applications, computing, etc.

**Lecture:**

*1.*  *Applications of analog interface circuits in electronic products:*

Applications of analog circuits in telecommunications, control, computing, biomedical applications, etc.

*2. Fundamental performance limits in analog circuits:*

Noise - distortion - dynamic range - signal-to-noise ratio; fundamental relationships between power, speed and accuracy

*3.Analog filters:*

Filter types: LP, HP, BP and BR; continuous time and discrete time filters; translating filter specifications in transfer functions: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Cauer, Bessel; filter synthis (b.m.o. software programme); filter structures and their properties: passive & active, continous time and discrete time

*4. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters:*

Principles and properties (resolution, linearity, ENOB); sampling and quantisation; architectures: Nyquist-rate digital-to-analog converters; Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital converters; oversampling (Delta-Sigma) converters; building blocks: S&H/T&H

*5. Phase-locked loop and oscillators:*

Principles and properties (acquisition/lock, phase noise); basic architecture and building blocks; applications: up/downconversion, data recovery, frequency synthesis; basic principles oscillators.

*6. DC-DC conversion:*

Principles of power supplies: linear regulators and switched-mode converters, both capacitive and inductive
