# S1 Design of Digital Platforms

**Aims:**

The course "design of digital platforms" aims to give the student insight into what a digital platform is through an overview of the different design steps and important design decisions in the development of a digital platform. Digital platforms make the connection between an application (e.g. multimedia) and the realization into embedded systems. The selection of a digital platform is essential in the design of electronic systems.

After this course, the students should be able to:

- explain the different steps and abstraction levels in the design process of a digital platform;
- explain the impact of a low-level design decision on the system level performance parameters, being latency, throughput, area, energy efficiency and flexibility;
- to discuss the trade-offs between these parameters;
- to derive a control flow graph and data flow graph for simple algorithms;
- be able to implement a simple signal processing algorithm on an embedded processor and/or hardware accelerator, using data and control flow graphs.
- be able to compute and optimize the delay and energy consumption of a simple gate-level circuit;
- explain the differences between available digital platforms and choose the best suited platform for a given application;
- assess the impact of technology scaling on the future of digital platform performance;

These goals are pursues through 3 activities:

**Lecture:**

The lecture series of the course "design of digital platforms" contains the following topics:

- Design of digital integrated circuits: translation from specificaties to implementation
- Different abstraction levels: design tasks, terminology and design environments
- Design goals: area, throughput, delay, power, energy, flexibility (HW/SW trade-off)
- Data flow graph and control flow graph: definition and usage during design of digital platforms
- HW/SW co-design
- Gate level design for low power and for low energy
- Usage of transformations at the algorithmic and hardware level to reach design goals
- Large variation of digital platforms for embedded systems
- Impact from technology scaling on digital platform design and selection
