This course is the supplemented course of my project. 

This Nand2Tetris course, as the starting point of study challenge, brings me on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery from the first principles, in which I go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program. The tremendous excitement of this course comes from the impulse of dismantle the "black box" and then build a complex and useful system from the ground up.

The first part of this course is focused on the hardware implementation. During this part, I revised the knowledge of **Basic Digital Circuit** and **Computer Organization. Furthermore, I also gained basics of **Assembly Language** and how to build a simple assembler.  Since this is an introductory course, it does not dive too much on the CMOS integrated circuit design and the computer architecture, which I will learn in the subsequent courses. 

By and large, I would like to sincerely thank Prof. Shimon Schocken and Prof. Noam Nisan for creating such an amazing course. I am really into the idea mentioned in this course [TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course) by Prof. Schocken, 

> Educators don't necessarily have to teach. Instead, they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own. Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment, these are the virtues of a great education.

这门课程是我学习挑战计划中的补充课程。

Nand2Tetris这门课程作为我学习挑战的起点，从第一性原理出发，以最基本的与非门为构建单元，自底向上的一步步构建逻辑门、CPU、内存、计算机架构、汇编语言一直到一台真正意义上能运行代码的通用计算机。这门课给我带来的兴奋感是来自于拆开黑盒子，并且能够在两位授课老师的引导下从零开始构建复杂的计算机系统。

这门课程第一部分注重于硬件平台的实现，我复习了相关的数字电路与计算机架构的知识，并且了解了粗浅的汇编语言以及汇编器的知识。由于这是一门导论课程，并没有涉及到更底层的模拟/数字CMOS集成电路设计的知识，这部分知识会在后面的课程中深入学习。

在这里由衷感谢两位教授制作出了如此精彩的课程。我很喜欢 Prof. Shimon Schocken 在这门课 [TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course) 上的一个观点：

> 教育工作者不一定必须要教学，相反，他们可以提供环境和资源来梳理出你与生俱来的自学能力，自我学习，自我发现，自我培养，这些都是伟大教育的优点。
